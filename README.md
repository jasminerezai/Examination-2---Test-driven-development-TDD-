# 🐷 Pig Dice Game

A terminal-based implementation of the classic **Pig Dice Game**, built in Python.  
This project was developed as part of the *Methods for Sustainable Programming (DA214A)* course at Kristianstad University.  
The game allows a human player to compete against a computer opponent with adjustable difficulty levels (Easy or Hard).

## 🎲 About the Game

PIG is a simple dice game with two players.  
Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a **1** is rolled or the player decides to **hold**.  
The player who first scores **100 or more points** wins.

### 📖 Game Rules

- The objective is to be the first player to reach **100 points** (or 10, in cheating mode is activated).
- On each turn, the player rolls a six-sided die.  
- If the player rolls a **1**, their turn ends and they receive **no points**.  
- If the player rolls any other number, they can choose to **roll again** or **hold** to keep their current round score.  
- If the player chooses to hold, their round score is added to their total score.  

### 💻 Computer Difficulty

If playing against the computer:  
- The player can select a difficulty level that affects the computer’s decision-making.  
- **Easy mode:** The computer stops rolling when it reaches **15 points** in a round or rolls a **1**.  
- **Hard mode:** The computer stops rolling when it reaches **25 points** in a round or rolls a **1**.
